# Blackjack by Robert Kolsek
## GA First Project
### Overview

My first project for General Assembly - **BLACKJACK**

What is Blackjack?

Blackjack is card game with the goal of the player beating the house.

#### You lose if...

1. ...you have a card value higher than 21
2. ...you have a lower card value than the house, if your card value is below 21
3. ...the house has a total card value of 21

#### You win if you...

1. ...have a total card value of 21
2. ...have a higher total card value than the house, if your card value is below 21

### Technologies used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Bootstrap Buttons

### Approach taken

Creating this game, I implemented content in this sequence:

1. Understanding the game rules and components involved
2. Creating the basic structure and functions
3. Identifying the basic game logic needed and that this is a player focussed game
4. Implementing players and game scenarios
5. Giving the game a GUI
6. Including Betting structure
7. Refactoring
8. Planning of AI players
9. Implementation of AI players

### Installation

Please download the files manually OR

```
git clone https://github.com/Flashrob/Blackjack.git
```

### Unsolved Problems

1. AI players' balance can go below 0
2. Split is not implemented
3. All cards are always face up
4. GUI is not responsive.
5. Small edge case gameplay bugs

### Learning Outcomes

1. Improved understanding of nested Loops
2. Learning about recursive functions
3. Improved knowledge of CSS positioning
4. Selective utilization of libraries
5. Understanding very basic AI
6. Appreciation for game development

   * IT IS **NOT** EASY!
